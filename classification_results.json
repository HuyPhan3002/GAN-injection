    "prompt": "Create a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\n\nFew-shot learning (FSL) is one of the key future steps in machine learning and raises a lot of attention. In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",

    "original_output": ".\n\nAbstract\n\nThis patent discloses a novel and innovative way of issuing community tax certificates and other relevant permits and clearances as digital certificates, using verifiable credentials, digital wallet on a blockchain as payment provision, and machine learning. The system architecture and algorithms are described in detail, as well as the processes involved.\n\nBackground\n\nThe issuance of community tax certificates and other relevant permits and clearances is a process that is often time-consuming and inefficient. The current methods of issuing these certificates and permits are often manual and paper-based, making them difficult to track and verify.\n\nSummary of Invention\n\nThe present invention provides a novel and innovative way of issuing community tax certificates and other relevant permits and clearances as digital certificates, using verifiable credentials, digital wallet on a blockchain as payment provision, and machine learning. The system architecture and algorithms are described in detail, as well as the processes involved.\n\nDetailed Description\n\nThe present invention provides a novel and innovative way of issuing community tax certificates and other relevant permits and clearances as digital certificates. The system architecture and algorithms are described in detail, as well as the processes involved.\n\nThe system architecture includes a verifiable credentials system, a digital wallet on a blockchain, and a machine learning system. The verifiable credentials system is used to securely store and manage the digital certificates. The digital wallet on a blockchain is used to securely store and manage the payments for the certificates. The machine learning system is used to analyze the data associated with the certificates and to make predictions about the likelihood of the certificates being accepted.\n\nThe process of issuing the certificates involves the following steps:\n\n1. The user submits an application for the certificate.\n\n2. The application is reviewed and approved by the relevant authorities.\n\n3. The user is issued a digital certificate, which is securely stored in the verifiable credentials system.\n\n4. The user pays for the certificate using the digital wallet on a blockchain.\n\n5. The machine learning system is used to analyze the data associated with the certificate and to make predictions about the likelihood of the certificate being accepted.\n\n6. The certificate is issued to the user.\n\nClaims\n\n1. A system for issuing community tax certificates and other relevant permits and clearances as digital certificates, comprising:\n\na) a verifiable credentials system for securely storing and managing the digital certificates;\n\nb) a digital wallet on a blockchain for securely storing and managing the payments for the certificates; and\n\nc) a machine learning system for analyzing the data associated with the certificates and making predictions about the likelihood of the certificates being accepted.\n\n2. A method for issuing community tax certificates and other relevant permits and clearances as digital certificates, comprising the steps of:\n\na) submitting an application for the certificate;\n\nb) reviewing and approving the application by the relevant authorities;\n\nc) issuing a digital certificate, which is securely stored in the verifiable credentials system;\n\nd) paying for the certificate using the digital wallet on a blockchain;\n\ne) using the machine learning system to analyze the data associated with the certificate and to make predictions about the likelihood of the certificate being accepted; and\n\nf) issuing the certificate to the user.",

However, we can make an educated guess based on the number of people on Earth and the average number of words spoken per person. \n\nFirst, we can estimate the population of Earth. According to the United Nations, the world population is approximately 7.8 billion people. \n\nNext, we can estimate the average number of words spoken per person. According to the National Center for Voice and Speech, the average person speaks approximately 16,000 words per day. \n\nFinally, we can use these two figures to estimate the total number of words spoken daily on Earth. To do this, we can multiply the population of Earth (7.8 billion) by the average number of words spoken per person (16,000). This gives us a total of 124.8 billion words spoken daily on Earth.",

An example of this is the peacock's tail.

It is a hybrid algorithm that uses insertion sort for small subarrays and merge sort for larger subarrays.\n\nThe following code implements Timsort in Lean 4:\n\nimport data.list.sort\n\n/- Timsort -/\n\ndef timsort {α : Type} (l : list α) : list α :=\n  let n := l.length in\n  if n ≤ 1 then l\n  else\n    let m := n / 2 in\n    let l1 := l.take m in\n    let l2 := l.drop m in\n    let l1' := l1.sort in\n    let l2' := l2.sort in\n    l1'.merge l2'\n\nThe code begins by importing the sort function from the list library. This is used to sort the subarrays.\n\nNext, the timsort function is defined. It takes a list of elements as an argument and returns a sorted list. The function first checks if the list is empty or has only one element. If so, it returns the list as is.\n\nOtherwise, the list is split into two subarrays. The first subarray is the first half of the list and the second subarray is the second half. The two subarrays are then sorted using the sort function. Finally, the two sorted subarrays are merged using the merge function.\n\nThis implementation of Timsort is efficient and easy to understand. It is also relatively simple to implement in Lean 4.",
